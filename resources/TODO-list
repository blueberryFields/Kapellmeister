Kapellmeister TODO-list:

Rename sequencers/instruments fucks up in ArrWin ✓

Remove instrument from ArrWin  ✓

set constant size on title-panel in ArrWin  ✓

Rename scenes  ✓

Set tick-grid to 1/64(?) and killLastNote on tick 64 when changing scenes  ✓

If partnotesChooser is set to !1/8 when generating new sequence sometimes it jumps back to 1/8???  ✓

Change from beatCounter to barCounter ✓

check solo/mute-function, seems to cause error if somethings is muted/soloed before pressing start ✓

Copy & paste sequences ✓

solo mute works a little wierd, if you solo an instrument and then unmute annother, maybe it should also be soloed otherwise the first one should be unsoloed ✓
